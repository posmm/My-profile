<div><p style="font-family:verdana;">I find nearly all aspects of the world around us fascinating and worthy of further understanding, this is particularly the case with IT.
<br>
<br>The difference in IT though, is that yesterday's expert can easily turn into today's layman. So while it can be hard to know where I personally might end up several years in the future, my current interest in IT is aimed particularly in the area of IT security.
<br>
<br>
My interest in IT as a field specifically is only a recent development, but I have always enjoyed learning and tinkering with systems. My earliest memory of trying to get into the workings of a PC involved me trying to install Ubuntu on an old Win 98 machine; and bricking it.
<br>
<br>
After this I was hooked on breaking things, now I think it's time I learn to fix them.
In my endeavors to learn to repair my mistakes I have ventured into other areas such as PC building (2.5 PCâ€™s to date), cloud hosting with virtual machines, game server hosting as well as the obligatory family tech support role.
<br>
<br>
This leads me to my studies at RMIT; chosen for the ability to study at home/online and offering courses that seemed to be directed at solid concepts and real world skills. It is here I hope to learn the requisite skills to change careers into the IT industry, hopefully culminating in IT security or a similar role.
