<div><p style="font-family:verdana;">
For my project idea I am introducing an idea I had several months ago for a video game. For the purpose of this project I will be using the working title, namely <i>War Lord</i>.
<br><br>
Unlike many war games which fall into either the FPS (first person shooter) or RTS (real time strategy), <i>War Lord</i> would combine both play styles into one game. The game would be massively multiplayer with up to 200 players in every match. Players would start out in a FPS style gameplay, as they gain experience they would be given the opportunity to play as unit (5 players), section (25 players), overall (whole team) commanders. At each advancement level, the gameplay would alter to increase the input the player has on the overall strategy of the game, culminating with a solely RTS style gameplay at “Overall commander” level.
<br><br>
The motivation for this game came from a conversation where several people were expressing how many of the large battle royale style games that are popular now suffer from a lack of leadership and team direction. Games such as Fortnite (Fortnite, 2020) or Apex Legends (Arts, 2020) often suffer from griefing and trolling as players have no real motivation to win. War Lord aims to solve that by making large scale team co-operation a key factor in winning the match, and by emulating how effective communication is key to warfare in real life.
<br><br>
In order to achieve this, gameplay will begin quite simply. For the first time player they will simply join a team of 5 players, either automatically matched or with friends. Prior to the match beginning teams will select a “Team leader”, experienced players will be given the option to play in “Commander” roles with the most experienced players given priority for higher level roles.
<br><br>
For clarity, roles (amounts shown are per team) and progression are as follows:
<br><br>
<b>Troop</b> (76 players)  > <b>Unit commander</b> (19 players)  > <b>Section commander</b> (4 players)  > <b>Overall commander</b> (1 player)
<br>
In the event of several similarly ranked players, commander roles would be randomly picked.
<br><br>
Upon commencement of play all “Troops” will be playing what we recognise as an FPS game, small unit gameplay and tactics will be their main priority; this is emphasized by the fact that they can only communicate with members of their own unit.
<br><br>
“Unit commanders” gameplay will be almost identical, playing alongside their unit. They will also be able to see other units in the area via an area map, and communicate via voice and text chat with the “Section commander” they are assigned to.
<br><br>
“Section commanders” too will play alongside their teammates, yet they will be in armoured vehicles. The role of the “Section commander” is to liase with the units in his section and the “Overall commander”. They will have the option to request air support, supply drops and order troop movements. By using the armoured vehicle, they will also have the option of acting as a reinforcement unit, quickly deploying to needed areas. The role of team mates of the “Section commander” is to protect that player from enemy troops as he will be an unarmed player.
<br><br>
The “Overall commander” is the only player on the team who can see the entire battlefield and the victory objective. He has the authority to order sections to move, and provide support via supply drops. The teams victory hangs on his ability to effectively manage troops, intelligence, supplies and support in a timely and cohesive manner. His role is purely strategic, with no battle space character.
<br><br>
Victory is achieved when one team meets the objective defined by the particular game mode or eliminates all the “Section commanders”.
<br><br>
All players will respawn upon elimination this will cause them to lose the XP multiplier they had. “Section commanders” will not respawn into their role but instead respawn as a standard troop. As “Section commanders’ are eliminated, the units under their control are assigned to other sections.
<br><br>
Unlike many popular games at the moment, weapons will not spawn in-game, instead players will spawn their chosen variants of weapons allowed in the gamemode being played. In-game XP will be awarded to players for eliminations and meeting objectives, this XP will serve as a combat multiplier increasing the effectiveness of the players weapons.
<br><br>
Obviously there would be many more nuances and game mechanisms not mentioned here, as well as changes that may be made during development and testing. But I wanted to highlight the sections that really emphasised how game play would imitate the issues of maintaining effective battlefield communication that is prevalent in real life, but never seems to be found in video games.
<br><br>
In order to make the game as described, Unreal Engine (Unreal Engine | The most powerful real-time 3D creation platform, 2020) seems like the most beneficial option. It is widely used to develop many games of similar genres and is free to use initially. For character and object design, Blender (Foundation, 2020) is highly regarded among many graphic designers for its power and is also free to use.
<br><br>
Epic (Hardware and Software Specifications, 2020) recommends the following hardware for using Unreal engine:
<br>Operating system: Windows 10 64bit
<br>Processor: Quad-core Intel or AMD, 2.5 GHz or faster
<br>Memory: 8GB RAM
<br>Video card/DirectX version: DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 compatible graphics
<br><br>
The listed hardware also is sufficient to run Blender (Foundation, 2020)
<br><br>
Unreal Engine uses C++ as its programming language, in order to develop the game I would need to become at least proficient in its usage. I would also need to learn how to use Unreal Engine and Blender for the graphic design component. Of course a game such as these would clearly need a team to work on its development so an expert level of knowledge would not be needed to start development.
<br><br>
Gaining the skills required would be the most difficult task. The hardware requirements are fairly standard, with most low-range gaming PCs exceeding the recommended specifications, and the software being used is either free, or free to begin with.
<br><br>
The desired outcome for this project would be successful multi-platform distribution of the game. Unfortunately for games such as the one described here, small team development is not a feasible option to bring it to a larger audience. In order of the game to be widely distributed there would also be many hurdles such as server hosting and matchmaking that would require substantial investment to launch.
<br>The video game industry however has repeatedly shown that both outright and in-game purchases can be commercially viable, along with massively multiplayer games being quite popular at the moment. As such, I believe it would not be far fetched to find a game studio to work along with once the initial design is complete.
