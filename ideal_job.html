<br><br>
The position chosen for my ideal job is that of a Cyber security analyst. This job encompasses a wide range of cyber security tasks incorporated under monitoring, detection and threat management. This job appeals to me as I have always found the area of information security quite fascinating. The challenges presented by a role such as this would be quite unique, not an everyday occurance for the average person.
<br>
I like the nature of contract work also, my current line of work is similar and find that the nature of conctact work forces you to maintaign a high level of skill and proficiency.
<br><br>
For this position the advertiser requires a minimum of two years experience in a similar role, and adds that the ability to work in a team is vital.
<br><br>
I currently do not have any of the IT skills the employer requires for this role. I do however have a great deal of experience working in a team environment as well as a hardworking attitude and am able to learn new concepts quite quickly.
<br><br>
In order to gain the skills required, I would need to complete a bachelor's degree in a relevant IT field, and obtain at least a CompTIA Security+ certification. To obtain the work experience, I will need to enter the IT workforce at a low level as a security, systems or network engineer and constantly work toward advancement; likely obtaining other certifications I am currently unaware of.
