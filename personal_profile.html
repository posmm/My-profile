Below are the the results to a Big five personality test (Big Five, 2020), Myers-Briggs personality test (16Personalities, 2020), and a learning style test (Personality Max, 2020)
<br>
<br>
Although the validity of these type tests may be called in to doubt, they can be a useful tool to help ourselves and others process aspects of our personality. I find that all three tests fairly clearly captured large aspects of my personality in ways that I was even surprised at. I think the learning style test can be quite beneficial in the learning environment as it will allow me to tailor my learning method to benefit me to a greater extent.
<br>
<br>
While I would hope to never be taken as the sum of an online test, I do believe that both personality tests showed I have high propensity towards taking the lead and being assertive, this can be a detrimental attitude if it is not received well by others, there are other individuals with a similar attitude, or when the subject area is well outside my knowledge base. These factors need to be considered quite thoroughly by myself primarily to ensure my personality will not cause issues in a team setting.
<br>
When forming a team I should look for members who are compatible with my leadership style. It is obviously near-impossible to cherry pick team members in such a way. As such it would behoove me to be open minded in team settings and to actively try to moderate my approach to individuals I am working with and to actually seek to work along with other assertive individuals who feel comfortable in telling me if my approach is overbearing.
